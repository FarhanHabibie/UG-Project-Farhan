UG Project Farhan Habibie 

The code in this repository is the code for XGBoost, GRNN and ARIMA for economic forecasting.

Code has been written in python on the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. The reason for Jupyter Notebooks is because its easy to run code in blocks to see each step.

Will update readme as development comes along.
